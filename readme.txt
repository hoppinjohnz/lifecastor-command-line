Lifecastor v0.4
Nov. 22, 2012

Instructions and hints:

1. Unzip the Lifecastor.zip to a folder. The folder can be your Downloads folder.

2. Open a command line prompt and change to the unzipped directory. There will be a few files there: 
    readme.txt (this is the file you are reading)
    lifecastor (main executable application file)
    plan.properties (default plan properties)
    deterministic-plan.properties (no probabilistic behavior, good for debugging)
    release.notes

3. Rename 'lifecastor' to 'lifecastor.exe'.

4. Type 'lifecastor.exe' to run the program. Type 'lifecastor.exe -h' for help.

5. Use options like -b, -t, -v and/or -c. You can combine them too.

6. Use any text editor to edit/make your properties in any file. By default, the application uses plan.properties file. Type 'lifecastor.exe deterministic-plan.properties' to use the other enclosed properties file. Feel free to use your own properties files.

7. New feature: Try -d option to see the difference between the current run and the very last run. Note: all your run history is saved in the file named '.history.res' so that you can examine it later.

You can run endless what-ifs about your own financial life forecast.
